# ScroogeSecretSanta
Create a secret santa network, where no user can get paired with someone in the same year or program.

The program reads in a csv file with the first column the student's name, the second column the student's year, the third column the student's 4 digit program identifier and the last column the student's email. It takes a command line argument of the number of students in the secret santa draw. The program output a csv file with the first and second column the "Santa's" name and email, and the third and fourth column who the "Santa" if giving the gift to and their email. Each pairing of students cannot be in the same year or program.
